4. Click ***Load Unpacked Extension*** and point it to ***browser-stack/app*** folder
5. On first install it sometimes does not load correctly. Just refresh and from now on it will work like a charm

***Disclaimer***

Testing this extension I have come to realize that browserstack loads data inconsistently. Because of this, I am not able to get the URL data so I left it blank so you can paste it in. Sometimes values will appear missing in the extension, but this is due to it not loading on the web page. Some of the older and less popular devices will show missing or malformed data. If you are having issues follow the troubleshooting instructions found below. If there is a device that is still not displaying the correct data send me an email.
